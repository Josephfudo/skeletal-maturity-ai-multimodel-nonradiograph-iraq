A Novel Multi-Modal Deep Learning System Using Smartphone Photography for Non-Radiographic Skeletal Maturity Assessment: Development and Validation Study
Project Title and Abstract
This project presents a novel, non-radiographic, multi-modal deep learning system for skeletal maturity estimation (SME) in pediatric dental populations. Developed and validated on data from 499 healthy Iraqi children aged 8–15 years, the system fuses five standardized smartphone photos (hand and intraoral) and tabular demographic/anthropometric data to estimate skeletal maturity stages using advanced deep learning and ensemble methods. The model demonstrates high accuracy, fairness, and clinical interpretability and provides a radiation-free, accessible clinical decision-support tool for timing preventive and interceptive dental treatments.​

Research Context
Skeletal maturity assessment is fundamental for effective dental preventive and interceptive therapy, yet traditional radiographic techniques pose risks and limitations—especially cumulative radiation and ethnic bias. This study addresses those challenges by developing and rigorously validating a deep learning approach using only non-radiographic imagery and simple clinical data, expanding access and equity for Middle Eastern pediatric populations. Data were collected in five governmental dental centers in Baghdad with ethical approval, standardized protocols, and expert labeling.​
